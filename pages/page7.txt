So there are two fundamental types of nodes in an XDI graph:
Context nodes and literal nodes. 

Context nodes can vary in their semantics and fulfill a number of
different functions, but they all behave the same way: They
establish the basic structure of the graph, and they always have
an address.

Literal nodes do not have an address in the graph, and they can exist
only under a value context node, and they are always leaf nodes in the
graph.

As has been mentioned before, there are three types of arcs
in a graph. So far, we have seen two: Contextual arcs and literal
arcs. Note that without the third type of arc (which we will see in
the next step), a graph would be a strictly hierarchical tree.
