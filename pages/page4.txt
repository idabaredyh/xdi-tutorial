<h1>Step 4: Context Nodes: Entities</h1>

<p>Let's add a few more context nodes to the graph.</p>

<p>Let's add <span class="xri">=bob</span> (another individual).</p>

<p>Let's add <span class="xri">@acme</span> (an organization).</p>

<p>We now have a graph consisting of 4 context nodes and 3 arcs.</p>

<p>Arcs that establish new context nodes are called <span class="term">"contextual arcs"</span>.
As we will see later, contextual arcs are one of three types of arcs.</p>

<p>Depending on the identifiers, context nodes can fulfill different functions in an XDI graph.
In this case, <span class="xri">=alice</span>, <span class="xri">=bob</span> and <span class="xri">@acme</span> are all considered 
<span class="term">entities</span>.</p>
