<h1>Step 1: Context Nodes: Entities</h1>

<p>Let's add a few more context nodes to the graph.</p>
<p>Let's add <b>=bob</b> (another individual).</p>
<p>Let's add <b>@acme</b> (an organization).</p>
<br>
<p>We now have a graph consisting of 4 context nodes and 3 arcs.</p>
<p>Arcs that establish new context nodes are called "contextual arcs".
As we will see later, contextual arcs are one of three types of arcs.</p>
<p>Depending on the identifiers, context nodes can fulfill different purposes in an XDI graph.
In this case, <b>=alice</b>, <b>=bob</b> and <b>@acme</b> are considered "entities".</p>
