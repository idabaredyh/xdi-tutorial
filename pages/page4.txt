Let's add a few more context nodes to the graph.
Let's add =bob (another individual).
Let's add @acme (an organization).

We now have a graph consisting of 4 context nodes and 3 arcs.
Such arcs that establish new context nodes are called "contextual arcs".
As we will see later, contextual arcs are one of three types of arcs in an XDI graph.
