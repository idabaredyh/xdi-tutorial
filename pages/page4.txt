<p>Let's add a few more context nodes to the graph.</p>
<p>Let's add =bob (another individual).</p>
<p>Let's add @acme (an organization).</p>
<br>
<p>We now have a graph consisting of 4 context nodes and 3 arcs.</p>
<p>Such arcs that establish new context nodes are called "contextual arcs".</p>
<p>As we will see later, contextual arcs are one of three types of arcs in an XDI graph.</p>
