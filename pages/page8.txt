The third type of arc is relational arcs. A relational arc
can be established between any two context nodes and describes
a relationship between them.

For example, a relational arc could be used to express that
=bob is a friend of =alice. In this case, +friend is the identifier
associated with the relational arc.

All arcs in XDI are directional. A second relational arc
could be created in the opposite direction, to express
that =alice is also a friend of =bob.
