<p>Now let's set a value for the =alice&lt;+email&gt; attribute. To do so, we
first create a value context node under the attribute context node.
The identifier for a contextual arc to a value context node is always &amp;.
Therefore the address of the value context node in the graph is =alice&lt;+email&gt;&.</p>

<p>In the value context node, we can now add a literal arc that establishes
a literal node. The identifier for a literal arc is also always &amp;.
Literal nodes hold the actual data in an XDI graph,
for example "alice@email.com". All JSON data types are supported.</p>
