Now let's add the <+email> context node under =alice. The < > symbols are used
to identify attributes. So while +email represents the general concept of
an e-mail address, <+email> represents an e-mail address as an attribute
of the context it is in.

The identifier associated with the contextual arc is <+email>.
The address of the new context node in the graph is =alice<+email>.
