<h1>Step 1: Context Nodes: Attributes</h1>

<p>Now let's add the <span class="xri">&lt;+email&gt;</span> context node under <span class="xri">=alice</span>. The &lt; &gt; symbols are used
to identify attributes. So while +email represents the general concept of
an e-mail address, <span class="xri">&lt;+email&gt;</span> represents an e-mail address as an attribute
of the context it is in, in this case the entity <span class="xri">=alice</span>.</p>
<br>
<p>The identifier associated with the contextual arc is <span class="xri">&lt;+email&gt;</span>.</p>
<p>The address of the new context node in the graph is <span class="xri">=alice</span><span class="xri">&lt;+email&gt;</span>.</p>
