<p>Now let's add the &lt;+email&gt; context node under =alice. The &lt; &gt; symbols are used
to identify attributes. So while +email represents the general concept of
an e-mail address, &lt;+email&gt; represents an e-mail address as an attribute
of the context it is in.</p>

<p>The identifier associated with the contextual arc is &lt;+email&gt;.</p>
<p>The address of the new context node in the graph is =alice&lt;+email&gt;.</p>
