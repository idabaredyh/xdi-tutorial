<h1>Step 1: Context Nodes: Attributes</h1>

<p>Now let's add the <b>&lt;+email&gt;</b> context node under <b>=alice</b>. The &lt; &gt; symbols are used
to identify attributes. So while +email represents the general concept of
an e-mail address, <b>&lt;+email&gt;</b> represents an e-mail address as an attribute
of the context it is in, in this case the entity <b>=alice</b>.</p>
<br>
<p>The identifier associated with the contextual arc is <b>&lt;+email&gt;</b>.</p>
<p>The address of the new context node in the graph is <b>=alice</b><b>&lt;+email&gt;</b>.</p>
