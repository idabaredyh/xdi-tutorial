<h1>Step 9: Statements</h1>

<p>An XDI graph can also be fully described as a set of statements.
In doing so, a statement corresponds directly to an arc in the graph.
Each statement consists of three parts: a subject, predicate and object.</p>

<p>For a contextual statement, the subject is the address of a context
node, the predicate is the empty string, and the object is the
contextual arc to the child context node.</p>

<p>For a literal statement, the subject is the address of a context node,
the predicate is &, and the object is the literal data.</p>

<p>For a relational statement, the subject is the address of a context
node, the predicate is the identifier associated with the relation,
and the object is the address of the target context node.</p>
