XDI is a way of modeling, storing, and manipulating data.
It fits into a similar category of technologies as JSON, XML and RDF, but also has a number
of properties that distinguishes it.
XDI is a graph-based data model. This means that all data is expressed using nodes and
arcs in a graph. At a minimum, a graph consists of a single node, called the "common root node".
