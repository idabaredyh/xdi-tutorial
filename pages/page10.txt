Listing all statements in a graph is a simple
way to serialize the graph into a string so it
can be stored or transmitted over a network.

Usually not all statements of the graph have to
be serialized in order to fully describe the graph.
Most contextual statements are usually implied by
other statements.

In our example, even though the graph consists of 
seven statements, only the three are actually needed
to fully describe the graph:

   //=alice
   //=bob
//@acme
   =alice//<+email>
   =alice<+email>//&
=alice<+email>&/&/”alice@email.com”
=alice/+friend/=bob
