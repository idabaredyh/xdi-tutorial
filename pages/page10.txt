<h1>Step 10: Statements</h1>

<p>Listing all statements in a graph is a simple
way to <span class="term">serialize the graph</span> into a string so it
can be stored or transmitted over a network.</p>

<p>Usually not all statements of the graph have to
be serialized in order to fully describe the graph.
Most contextual statements are usually <span class="term">implied</span> by
other statements.</p>

<p>In our example, even though the graph consists of 
<span class="term">seven</span> statements, only <span class="term">three</span> are actually needed
to fully describe the graph:</p>

<p>
<span class="xri">
//=alice<br>
//=bob<br>
//@acme<br>
=alice//&lt;+email&gt;<br>
=alice&lt;+email&gt;//&<br>
=alice&lt;+email&gt;&amp;/&amp;/”alice@email.com”<br>
=alice/+friend/=bob<br>
</span>
</p>

<p>
<span class="xri">
//@acme<br>
=alice&lt;+email&gt;&amp;/&amp;/”alice@email.com”<br>
=alice/+friend/=bob<br>
</span>
</p>
