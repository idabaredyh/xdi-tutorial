<h1>Step 10: Statements</h1>

<p>Listing all statements in a graph is a simple
way to serialize the graph into a string so it
can be stored or transmitted over a network.</p>

<p>Usually not all statements of the graph have to
be serialized in order to fully describe the graph.
Most contextual statements are usually implied by
other statements.</p>

<p>In our example, even though the graph consists of 
seven statements, only the three are actually needed
to fully describe the graph:</p>

<p>
//=alice<br>
//=bob<br>
<span class="xri">//@acme</span><br>
=alice//&lt;+email&gt;<br>
=alice&lt;+email&gt;//&<br>
<span class="xri">=alice&lt;+email&gt;&amp;/&amp;/”alice@email.com”</span><br>
<span class="xri">=alice/+friend/=bob</span><br>
</p>
