<p>To represent =alice in the XDI graph, a new node is created under the common root node.
The identifier =alice is associated with the arc that connects the two context nodes (see diagram).</p>

<p>In XDI, these nodes are also called "context nodes", since they create new contexts to
nest more data under them.</p>

<p>=alice is the identifier associated with the arc, and at the same time it is also the "address"
of the new context node in the graph.</p>
