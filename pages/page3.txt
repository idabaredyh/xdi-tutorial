<h1>Step 3: Context Nodes</h1>

<p>To represent <span class="xri">=alice</span> in the XDI graph, a new node
is created under the common root node. The identifier <span class="xri">=alice</span>
is associated with the arc that connects the two context nodes (see diagram).</p>

<p>In XDI, these nodes are also called <span class="term">context nodes</span>, since they create
new contexts to nest more data under them.</p>

<p><span class="xri">=alice</span> is the identifier associated with the arc, and at the same time
it is also the <span class="term">address</span> of the new context node in the graph.</p>
