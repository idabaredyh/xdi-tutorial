To represent =alice in the XDI graph, a new node is created under the common root node.
The identifier =alice is associated with the arc that connects the two context nodes (see diagram).

In XDI, these nodes are also called "context nodes", since they create new contexts to
nest more data under them.

=alice is the identifier associated with the arc, and at the same time it is also the "address"
of the new context node in the graph.
