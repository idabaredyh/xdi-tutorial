<h1>Step 2: Cloud Number.</h1>

<p>Cloud Number.</p>

<p>An xdi authority has the ability to change a registered cloud name at any point, i.e, the cloud name is reassignable. 
Thus, for technical reasons, a secondary identifier is needed that doesn't change and the cloud number provides this function. 
It is a unique identifier which is a system generated value and does not change over the lifecycle of the personal cloud. 
A cloud number is constructed as a UUID (Universally Unique Identifier) and although the UUID is a 36 character long value,
for this tutorial's purposes, we will use simple UUIDs for each of the xdi authorities described in Chapter 1.</p>
