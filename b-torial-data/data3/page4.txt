<h1>Step 3: XDI References</h1>

<p>$ref, $is$ref</p>

<p>Whenever an XDI graph contains two context nodes that represent the same entity, the equivalance of these two nodes is asserted by a $ref relationship.
In the example graph here the context node with a cloud name and another context name with a cloud number represent the same xdi authority.
The $ref relationship establishes that fact and the inverse is represented by a $is$ref relationship</p>
