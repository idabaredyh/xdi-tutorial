<h1>Step 6: Inner Roots</h1>

<p>Inner Roots</p>

<p>An inner root note node represents an inner graph, i.e., a graph-within-a-graph. 

Example of an inner root node.
(=alice/#owns)

The XDI address of an inner root node will contain two XDI address segments, an XDI subject (=alice) followed by XDI relational predicate (#owns).

The XDI statements contained in an inner graph are relative only to that particular inner root node.</p>
