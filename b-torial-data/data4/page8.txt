<h1>Step 8: Operations</h1>

<p>So far we have looked at the "metadata" of a message: recipient,
link contract, and authentication materials.</p>

<p>The "heart" of a message however is the set of <span class="term">operations</span>
to be executed against the target graph. The following operations exist:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="code">$set</span>: Adds data to the target graph.</li>
<li><span class="code">$del</span>: Deletes data from the target graph.</li>
<li><span class="code">$get</span>: Retrieves data from the target graph.</li>
</ul>

<p>Operations are modeled as relational arcs on a <span class="code">$do</span> entity
singleton under the entity that represents the message.</p>

<p>In general, these operations can be applied either to a 
<span class="term">target address</span> or a
<span class="term">target statement</span> or a combination of both.</p>

<p>And just like a message envelope can contain multiple messages, a message can
contain multiple operations.</p>
