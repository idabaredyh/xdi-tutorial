<h1>Step 3: Context Nodes</h1>

<p>To represent <span class="code">=alice</span> in the XDI graph, a new arc and node
are created under the common root node.</p>

<p>In XDI, these nodes are also called <span class="term">context nodes</span>, since they create
new contexts to nest more data under them.</p>

<p>The arcs that establish new context nodes are called <span class="term">contextual arcs</span>.
As we will see later, contextual arcs are one of three types of arcs.</p>

<p><span class="code">=alice</span> is the identifier associated with the contextual arc, and at the same time
it is also the address of the context node in the graph.</p>
