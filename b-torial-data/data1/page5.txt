<h1>Step 5: Context Nodes: Attributes</h1>

<p>Now let's add an <span class="code">&lt;#email&gt;</span> context node under <span class="code">=alice</span>.
The <span class="code">&lt; &gt;</span> symbols are used
to identify context nodes that function as <span class="term">attributes</span>.</p>

<p>So while <span class="code">#email</span> would represent the general concept of
an e-mail address, <span class="code">&lt;#email&gt;</span> represents an e-mail address as an attribute
of the context it is in, in this case the entity <span class="code">=alice</span>.</p>

<p>The identifier associated with the new contextual arc is <span class="code">&lt;#email&gt;</span>.</p>

<p>The address of the new context node in the graph is <span class="code">=alice</span><span class="code">&lt;#email&gt;</span>.</p>
