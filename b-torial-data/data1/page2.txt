<h1>Step 2: Syntax</h1>

<p>The first thing to learn about XDI is that to build a graph, it uses
identifiers with important syntactical symbols. For example, the '=' symbol
is used to identify individuals, therefore a reasonable identifier for
an individual called "Alice" would be
<span class="code">=alice</span>.</p>

<p>The list on the left illustrates the most important symbols.</p>

<p>This means that unlike in RDF and other data models, XDI identifiers are not "opaque".
Instead, they have certain semantics "built-in".</p>
