<h1>Step 8: Relations</h1>

<p>The third type of arc is <span class="term">relational arcs</span>. A relational arc
can be established between any two context nodes and describes
a relationship between them.</p>

<p>For example, a relational arc could be used to express that
<span class="code">=bob</span> is a friend of <span class="code">=alice</span>. In this case,
<span class="code">#friend</span> is the identifier associated with the relational arc.</p>

<p>All arcs in XDI are directional. A second relational arc
could be created in the opposite direction, to express
that <span class="code">=alice</span> is also a friend of <span class="code">=bob</span>.</p>
