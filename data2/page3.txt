<h1>Step 3: Instances</h1>

<p>Collections contain <span class="term">instances</span>.
In this diagram, we have an <span class="term">entity collection</span> containing three
<span class="term">entity instances</span>. Each one of them can contain entities and
attributes that describe the given instance.</p>

<p>XDI distinguishes between <span class="term">unordered instances</span>
and <span class="term">ordered instances</span>. In this diagram,
the instances are unordered and
identified by UUIDs (shortened here for display
purposes).</p>

<p>The addresses of the three entity instances in the graph are:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="xri">=alice[#event]!:uuid:7328
=alice[#event]!:uuid:4439
=alice[#event]!:uuid:8294
</span>
</p>
