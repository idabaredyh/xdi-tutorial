<h1>Step 3: Instances</h1>

<p>Collections contain <span class="term">instances</span>.
In this diagram, we have an entity collection containing three
entity instances. Each one of them can contain entities and
attributes that describe the given instance.</p>

<p>XDI distinguishes between <span class="term">unordered instances</span>
and <span class="term">ordered</span>
instances. In this diagram, the instances are unordered and
identified by UUIDs (which are shortened here for display
purposes.</p>

<p>The addresses of the three entity instances in the graph are:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="xri">=alice[+event]!:uuid:7328
=alice[+event]!:uuid:4439
=alice[+event]!:uuid:8294
</span>
</p>
