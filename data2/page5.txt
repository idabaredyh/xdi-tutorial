<h1>Step 5: Instances</h1>

<p>This diagram shows an attribute collection with
unordered attribute instances.</p>

<p>Entity collections and attribute collections work in very
similar ways. The only difference is that in case of the latter, the
<span class="xri">&lt; &gt;</span></p> symbols are used for
both the collection itself, and for its instances.</p>

<p>The addresses of the three attribute instances in the graph are:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="xri">=alice[<+email>]<!:uuid:4928>
=alice[<+email>]<!:uuid:2093>
=alice[<+email>]<!:uuid:8829>
</span>
</p>
