<h1>Step 2: Collections</h1>

<p>Context nodes can also function as <span class="term">collections</span>, which
are containers for <span class="term">instances</span> of entities or
attributes. Entities and attributes that are not instances
of a collection (such as the ones we saw in Tutorial 1) are
also called <span class="term">singletons</span>.</p>

<p>As is the case with all fundamental constructs in XDI, 
collections and instances also have dedicated syntactical
symbols.</p>

<p>The <span class="xri">[Â ]</span> symbols are used to identify context nodes that function as
<span class="term">collections</span>.</p>

<p>If the <span class="xri">[ ]</span>
and the <span class="xri">&lt; &gt;</span> symbols are combined,
we have an <span class="term">attribute collection</span>, otherwise we
have an <span class="term">entity collection</span>.</p>
