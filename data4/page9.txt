<h1>Step 9: $set on a Target Address</h1>

<p>When a <span class="xri">$set</span> operation is applied to a 
<span class="term">target address</span>, that address
is created in the target graph. All nodes and arcs that are necessary
to establish the new address are created automatically.</p>

<p>If the target address exists already in the target graph, that is
not considered an error.</p>

<p>Target graph before the message:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="xri">//@acme
//=alice
</span>
</p>

<p>Message:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="xri">=bob[$msg]!:uuid:4378$do/$set/=alice&lt;+email&gt;&amp;
</span>
</p>

<p>Target graph after the operation:</p>

<p class="indent">
<span class="xri">//@acme
=alice&lt;+email&gt;//&amp;
</span>
</p>
