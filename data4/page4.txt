<h1>Step 4: The Structure of an XDI Message</h1>

<p>Ordered entity instances can be used as well, instead of
unordered entity instances:</p>

<ul>
<li><span class="xri">=bob[$msg]@0</span></li>
<li><span class="xri">=bob[$msg]@1</span></li>
<li><span class="xri">=bob[$msg]@2</span></li>
</ul>

<p>This should be done if the messages have to be executed
in a particular order by the XDI server.</p>

<p>So far, the messages are empty, i.e. they would not do anything
if executed against a target graph.</p>
